# About Me
I'm an M.Sc student at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/), working on Natural Language Processing and Causal Inference. Sometimes I also play with general deep learning and even optimization algorithms. My advisor is [Prof. Roi Reichart](https://iew.technion.ac.il/~roiri/).
